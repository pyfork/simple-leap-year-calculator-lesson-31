#### Side note

- Lesson 31
- Use draw.io to visualize the logic. Draw first. Read logic. Then write code.
- Nested if statements in summary:
  - inner if statement will be checked if outer if statement is deemed true
- Elif statements in summary:
  - next elif will be checked if the prior if statement is deemed not true
- New to Python and not so sharp with logic when first attempted this
- Took me 2 days to bend my mind
